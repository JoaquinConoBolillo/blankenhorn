The primary fault line dividing the two groups will not be race, religion, <BR>
class, education, or gender. It will be patrimony. One group will consist <BR>
of those adults who grew up with the daily presence and provision of fathers. <BR>
The other group will consist of those who did not. By the early years of the <BR>
next century, these two groups will be roughly the same size. <BR>

Surely a crisis of this scale merits a response. At a minimum, it requires a serious debate. Why is fatherhood 
declming? What can be done about it? Can our society find ways to invigorate effective fatherhood as a norm 
of male behavior? Yet, to date, the public discussion on this topic has been remarkably weak and defeatist. There 
is a prevailing belief that not much can—or even should—be done to reverse the trend. When the crime rate 
jumps, politicians promise to do something about it. 

When the unemployment rate rises, task forces assemble to address the problem. As random shootings increase, public 
health officials worry about the preponderance of guns. But when it comes to the mass defection of men from family 
life, not much happens. 

There is debate, even alarm, about specific social problems. Divorce. Out-of-wedlock childbearing. Children growing 
up in poverty. Youth vio lence. Unsafe neighborhoods. Domestic violence. The weakening of parental authority. 
But in these discussions, we seldom acknowledge the underlying phenomenon that binds together these otherwise disparate 
issues; the flight of males from their children’s lives. In fact, we seem to go out of our way to avoid the connection 
between our most pressing social problems and the trend of fatherlessness.
